# Revisit one of the previous lab exercises that were challenging for you.
# Write a test suite that checks for the correct functionality of the code.
# Then try to refactor your solution, maybe you can make the code more
# concise or more elegant? Keep checking whether you broke the functionality
# by repeatedly running your test suite against your changes.
